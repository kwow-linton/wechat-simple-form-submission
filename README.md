# wechat-simple-form-submission
### Overview
WeChat is the most popular online community in China, and the mini-program is its sub-function, which can provide a native app experience in WeChat.
In a way, I consider WeChat mini program as a unique front-end framework in China.
And in this project, I developed a simple form-submitting program based on the WeChat mini-program, which selected the diango as its backend framework.
